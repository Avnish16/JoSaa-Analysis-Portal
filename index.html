            <li><h2>Seat Matrix 2023</h2></li>
            <p>The seat matrix of Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) for the year 2023 is represented in the pie chart below. 
               The chart illustrates the distribution of seats among the different IITs based on their respective seat capacities.
               The pie chart provides a visual representation of the number of seats available in each IIT. 
               Each slice of the pie corresponds to a specific IIT, and the size of the slice indicates the proportionate number 
               of seats allocated to that particular institution.
               The chart reveals the variations in seat capacities across the IITs. Some IITs have a larger number of seats, 
               while others have a relatively smaller number. This distribution reflects the different admission capacities and 
               focus areas of the individual IITs.
               Please refer to the chart to get an overview of the seat matrix of IITs in the given year.

                The table below showcases the NIRF rankings of Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) in the year 2023. 
                These rankings reflect the overall performance and excellence of each institution in the field of technical 
                education and research.</p>
